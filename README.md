# chat_cli

I asked the chat bot what would be a good name for this cli chat bot and this what it responded with.

Some cool names for a command line chat bot could be:

- Terminal Talker
- Commandline Conversationalist
- Prompt Pal
- Console Chatty Cathy
- Bash Buddy
- Shell Shapeshifter
- Cli Chatbot
- Commandline Companion
- Terminal Talkbot
- Prompt Pal 2.0

I decide to go with cli_companion
